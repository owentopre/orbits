To run the simulation you must first run the bodies.py file to load the initial conditions from JPL Horizons (if using the bodies already supplied in the file)
Then the Simulation.py file should be run with time scale, step and approximation method selected beforehand
Then list the bodies you wish to plot in the Plot.py 'planets' array (using their index in the 'bodies' array from Bodies.py)
Run Plot.py to show a graph of the xy positions of the bodies supplied
